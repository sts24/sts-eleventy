excerpt: A journal of hiking photography
---
Trail Coffee was a side project I created to share my hiking photography. The original version of the site was launched in 2015 using a besopke WordPress theme I developed to get exactly what I needed out of the site. At the time, this theme used several backend functions to help with customizing each post. For example, each region was defined by a category and given a custom accent color. The site also used several plugins such as Jetpack and WP-GPX-Maps to display map location and GPS data from the hikes.

In 2019, I moved this off WordPress to Eleventy. This JAMstack version is hosted on Netlify. Eleventy is a fantastic static-site generator written in Node JS and gives developers a great deal of flexibility with combining your template language of choice with data stored in Markdown files or any other data store you want to bring.
