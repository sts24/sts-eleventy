excerpt: A journal of hiking photography
---
Trail Coffee was a side project I created to share my hiking photography. This site was built on WordPress with a theme I developed. This theme also uses several backend functions to help with customizing each post. For example, each region is defined by a category and given a custom accent color. The site also uses several plugins such as Jetpack and WP-GPX-Maps to display map location and GPS data from the hikes.
