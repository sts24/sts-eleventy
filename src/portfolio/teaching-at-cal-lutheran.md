## 2012 â€“ 2018

For several years, I taught undergraduate students in the Multimedia and Art departments at Cal Lutheran. My students were instructed in the basics of graphic design, typography, web design, animation, and video production. This was an entry level class that was popular with all types of students including those there for their major requirement.

Being out of college for a while now, this was a great opportunity to better understand what the experience of younger people is currently in college and how they approach technology.
