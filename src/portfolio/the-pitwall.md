excerpt: A project written in Vue to explore the historical records of Formula 1 racing.
---
## Explore historical records of past Formula 1 championships.</h2>

This project was written originally with Vue, but it has also been ported to React. It uses Axios to call up the  <a href="https://ergast.com/mrd/">Ergast API</a>  for historical Formula 1 data. The Ergast API has data going back to the first World Championship in 1950.

I am a big Formula 1 fan (yes, I am also an American, which nobody knows about F1 here) and I wanted to make up a personal project to learn more about Vue and making a reactive single page app. While the functionality is fully established, I plan on added some polish to UI over time.

Originally, this project started out as a way to learn about the new world of javascript frameworks. I first wrote this app in Vue using Vue CLI. Then it was ported to React so I could compare how the process would compare with the same app with a different approach. Most recently, I rewrote it with the Vue framework Nuxt. This allows me to easily use the same Vue components as before with the advantage of creating a static generated version of the app for better performance.
