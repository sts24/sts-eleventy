## Explore historical records of past Formula 1 championships.</h2>

This project was written originally with Vue, but it has also been ported to React. It uses Axios to call up the  <a href="https://ergast.com/mrd/">Ergast API</a>  for historical Formula 1 data. The Ergast API has data going back to the first World Championship in 1950.

I am a big Formula 1 fan (yes, I am also an American, which nobody knows about F1 here) and I wanted to make up a personal project to learn more about Vue and making a reactive single page app. While the functionality is fully established, I plan on added some polish to UI over time.
