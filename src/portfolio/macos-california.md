macOS California is a little web app that uses Mapbox maps and Gridsome/Vue to showcase where the names of macOS releases are located in the state of California.

It's a simple site, but it gave me the opportunity to learn more about the Gridsome framework. This framework uses Vue for front-end templates with GraphQL as the data model. I was already a fan of working with Vue, so this was all a natural fit to up and running.
