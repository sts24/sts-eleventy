The Creative Action Network is a collective of artists designing and illustrating for important causes. In 2014, I contributed to the See American campaign. This campaign was aimed to promote the then upcoming 100th anniversary of the National Park Service and raise money for the National Parks Conservation Association. The name of See America was a callback to the 1930â€™s New Deal-era advertising campaign to encourage Americans to explore our great public lands.

I have been a resident of Ventura County for several years now and decided to contribute with a poster of the Channel Islands National Park, just off the coast from where I live.

In 2016, this was included in the See America book, which was available in National Park gift shops across the country. In 2018, my design was selected for the 2019 See American wall calendar.
