## Professional
- Diving deep into WordPress' admin hooks. Expirmenting if WP can be used as a place to store related data and returning it through the Rest API.
- Playing around with the beta of Panic's new Nova editor, the replacement for Coda. Liking it a lot, but have got into a real groove in the past year or two with VS Code.
- Expirmenting with different ways core javascript driven widgets can be adpated to be more accessible.

## Personal
- Like everyone, sheltering in place.
- Raising my baby son, changing diapers.
- Dreaming of traveling again
- Looking forward to Mandalorian Season 2!
