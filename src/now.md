## Professional
- Diving deep into WordPress' admin hooks. Expirmenting if WP can be used as a place to store related data and returning it through the Rest API.
- Playing around with the beta of Panic's new Nova editor, the replacement for Coda. Liking it a lot, but have got into a real groove in the past year or two with VS Code.
- Continuing to tweak my little side projects in Vue and React.
- Hoping to spend more time putting UX design skills to practive again. I've been so focused as a developer, I would like to spend more time in my roots as a visual designer.

## Personal
- Like everyone, sheltering in place.
- Raising my baby son, changing diapers.
- Watching mostly YouTube lately
- Watching old Formula 1 races since the real thing isn't happening right now.
