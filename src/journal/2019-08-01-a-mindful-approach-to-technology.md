<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Instead of <em>more</em>, often what we consider to be the “best” app is the one that actually ends up doing <em>less</em>.  Less, but better. The best app is often the one that allows you to  easily do what you came for, then releases you to get back to what is  really important. The best app is the one that allows you to honestly  answer “yes” to the question:<br><br><em>Is this the best way to use this technology to support my values?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I am really interested in seeing this new direction from The Sweet Setup. The time and attention our devices occupy is a topic I think about a lot lately, especially as my wife and I are expecting our first kid in a few months.</p>
