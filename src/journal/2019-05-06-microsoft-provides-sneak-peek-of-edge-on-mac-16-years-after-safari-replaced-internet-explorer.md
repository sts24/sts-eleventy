Microsoft moving Edge over to Chromium has been such a big story this year in the web development world and now we have a preview of the upcoming Mac version.

In the very early days when I was first learning about web design, I remember when Internet Explorer 5 on the Mac was released with a big splash. It was ahead of it's Windows cousin in terms of page rendering and offered a theme selection to match your candy colored iMac.

Today, I see this about Edge coming to the Mac and have to wonder who is this for? Other than web developers who are going to test their site while using a Mac, what is the selling point for non-developers?
