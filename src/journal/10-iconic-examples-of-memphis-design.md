I never knew there was a name to this style, but the Memphis Style of design exactly pinpoints what I think of early-mid 90s industrial design. Near where I grew up in the 90s there was a mall that opened up, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Mills">Ontario Mills</a>, that embodied this style.
