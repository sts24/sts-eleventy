<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>NetNewsWire is all about three things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The open web</li>
    <li>High-quality open source Mac and iOS apps</li>
    <li>The community that loves both of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>Supporting all these things takes work.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can get on board with all three things. Looking forward to seeing this classic app make it's come back.</p>
