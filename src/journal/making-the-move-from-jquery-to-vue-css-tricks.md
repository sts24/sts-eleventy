<blockquote>As someone who has used jQuery for many. years and has recently become a Vue convert, I thought it would be an interesting topic to discuss the migration process of working with one to the other.</blockquote>

When I first starting to work professionally in web development ten or so years ago, jQuery was the all the rage as it was addressing a lot of short comings of native Javascript in that era. As time has gone on, native JS has pretty addressed all of those short comings. Although the main website I work on has carried over with jQuery, I wouldn't touch it at all in 2019 for any new site I would be building.

That being said... I really like working with Vue and for now it is addressing a new set of shortcomings that hoping will be superseded at some point in the future by Web Components and other new-age native features.

Having worked more than a decade now on the web, it is safe to say that the more things change the more they stay the same.
