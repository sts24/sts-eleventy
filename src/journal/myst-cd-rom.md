Loved hearing the stories about how Myst was able to run on early 90s CD-ROMs. The games from the Miller Brothers and Cyan were really formative to my upbringing into using computers as a child. Rand mentions at one point about people he has met saying they remember watching their mom or dad playing Myst. That was totally me watching my dad play.
